ConvolutionalEmotion
====================

A deep convolutional neural network system for live emotion detection

How to run:

Execute zengame.py with Python 2.7 64 bit. Works on Linux (tested on Ubuntu, with Anaconda). DeCAF (https://github.com/UCB-ICSI-Vision-Group/decaf-release/) needs to be installed, as well as numpy, opencv, pygame (only if you want to play the simple game that changes based on your facial expression) and sklearn.
